# Generative Pre-trained Image Prior for MRI reconstruction

This package is to help you extract prior information for MRI image and then use it for MRI reconstruction. 

# Installation

1. Install with pip command
   ```shell
   $ pip install spreco
   ```

2. Clone this repository and use [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to set up the environment.

   ```shell
   $ git clone https://github.com/mrirecon/spreco.git
   $ cd spreco
   $ conda env create --file env.yml -n work
   $ conda activate work
   $ pip install .
   ```
